<h2>Why I Love Bread</h2>
<p> I love bread. I don't know what it is about it because it is very plain and boring but I still love it. Every time I go out to an Italian resturant, I tend to fill up on the bread they give out before hand because it's really good. However, it <strong>NEEDS</strong> to be fresh. Once it's frozen, it just does not taste as good. </p>
